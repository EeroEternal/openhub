# AGENTS.md — Code Agent Collaboration Specification

This document serves as the **high-density, lightweight entry point (attention steering weight)** for all AI coding agents across this repository. Its primary purpose is to eliminate hallucinations, prevent piggybacking changes, and ensure reproducible commits and PRs. Detailed guidelines are split across [`docs/ai/agents/`](docs/ai/agents/) and `.agents/skills/`; **do NOT load all chapters into context by default**.

## Knowledge Tiering & Token Budget Discipline

| Tier | Content | Entry Point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Standing Constraints** | Inviolable rules across all tasks | This file ("Always Active"); expanded in [`docs/ai/agents/`](docs/ai/agents/) |
| **Reusable Workflows** | Domain-specific procedures & validation commands (Token Relief Valve) | `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` (Authoritative) |
| **Vendor/Env Bridges** | Tooling or Cloud VM nuances | [`docs/ai/`](docs/ai/) (No root bifurcation allowed) |
| **Domain Specs** | UI / Architecture / Data abstractions | [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) + [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) |

- **Token Budget & Zero-Sum Updates**: As a resident system prompt weight, this file has a strict hard limit of **80 lines / 1200 Tokens**. Near the limit, follow the **zero-sum rule (add one, remove one)**.
- **Anti-Anecdote & Batch Threshold**: Never add global rules based on isolated single-session mistakes. Rules must appear in **≥ 2 independent session transcripts** and be refined via skill [`promote-lesson`](.agents/skills/promote-lesson/SKILL.md) with explicit human review.

| Cross-module boundaries / crate splitting / SQL joins | [`module-boundaries.md`](docs/architecture/module-boundaries.md) |

## Always Active (Highest Standing Constraints)

1. **No Piggybacking**: Commits/PRs must not carry unrelated changes; unannounced tuning, repo-wide formatting, undocumented `#[allow]`, and cross-module opportunistic refactoring are strictly prohibited. Violations must be split via `git reset --mixed HEAD~1`.
2. **Zero Hallucination Code**: Every definition must have callers; every cache field must have a store policy; metrics must track both success and failure; every `TODO` must reference an issue. Design docs must never cite skeleton-only features as existing capabilities.
3. **Safe Stash**: Honest stash naming; `git diff --stat` before stash; `cargo check --tests` required after pop; never stash `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, or build scripts.
4. **Release Guardrail**: Explain outcomes to users after local closed-loop verification; **merging to main or creating release tags is strictly prohibited without explicit human approval**.
5. **UI stack + viewport**: Product UI is the in-repo React kit (`admin/` or `frontend/`). **Never** ship parallel HTML/JS pages. Dialogs `max-h-[85vh]` + `overflow-y-auto`. No casual subtitles. Global config only on Settings.
6. **Admin i18n & Linguistic Purity**: All user-visible copy must use `t('namespace.key')` and be written symmetrically to `zh.ts` and `en.ts`. Mixed languages are strictly prohibited.
7. **Sorting & Search Clarity**: Entity sorting options must explicitly indicate direction (e.g., "Created (New → Old)"); search placeholder text must truthfully state searchable fields.
8. **Core Data Plane vs. Plugin Boundary**: Custom business logic (headers, auth decoration, masking, session tracking) **must be implemented as Plugins/Middleware**, never hardcoded into the core data pipeline.
9. **Release Promoter Process**: Tagging and releasing must follow skill [`release`](.agents/skills/release/SKILL.md) (full local gate re-run → multi-point check → human approval hard stop → deployment verification).
10. **Pre-push Local Quality Gate**: Never use CI as a local sandbox; run full local quality gates (fmt, clippy, tests, admin tsc/build) via skill [`pre-push-local-gates`](.agents/skills/pre-push-local-gates/SKILL.md) before pushing.
